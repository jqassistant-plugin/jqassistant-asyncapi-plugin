*Developer notes:*

- headers and payload (rely on schema / multi format schema) in traits, messages - not implemented yet
- security schemes -> OAuthFlow Attributes: single mapper for each is required to set the right path (e.g. implicit, password...)
- bindings - basic structure is available, but only few protocols are supported
- the Specification Extensions property is not supported at the moment
- implement exchange and amqp queue mappers and decorators to support amqp channel binding fully
