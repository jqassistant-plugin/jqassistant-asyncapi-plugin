*what's missing:*

- headers and payload (rely on schema / multi format schema) in traits, messages
- schemas totally missing
- security schemes -> OAuthFlow Attributes: single mapper for each is required to set the right path (e.g. implicit, password...)

- bindings - idea of basic structure is available, but only few protocols are supported
- bindings do not work properly - therefore set ignore

*further notes:*

- found out nothing more about external Docs as a Map<String, ExternalDocs>;
OpenApi uses the only ExternalDocs Object as the async api examples do - ignore till encountering one?

- mention Springwolf-AsyncApi (base of async api model classes)*
- the Specification Extensions property is not suppoerted at the moment
